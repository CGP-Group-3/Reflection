# Reflection

Reflection is a smart mirror and scale that aims to help the group's specific user, John, control his weight, be it losing or maintaining. The user is able to view his weight data via the interface displayed on the smart mirror. He is also able to weigh himself on the scale. The mirror and scale communicate using WiFi so that John can view his data on the interface.

## Technologies

Arduino (C++)\
Processing (Java)

The interface was created using Processing. The mirror will use a Raspberry Pi to run the visualisation since it is essentially a computer. The scale uses an Arduino microcontroller and will run a program written in the Arduino C++ language.
